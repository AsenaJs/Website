# CLI Overview

The Asena CLI is a powerful command-line tool that streamlines Asena application development. It handles project scaffolding, code generation, building, and development workflows.

## What is Asena CLI?

Asena CLI provides essential tools for building and managing Asena applications:

- **Project Scaffolding** - Create new projects with complete setup
- **Code Generation** - Generate controllers, services, middleware, and more
- **Build System** - Bundle your application for production
- **Development Mode** - Hot reload and automatic compilation
- **Multi-Adapter Support** - Works with both Ergenecore and Hono adapters

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ Quick Project Setup

Create a fully configured Asena project in seconds with interactive prompts for adapter selection, ESLint, and Prettier setup.

### ðŸ”§ Code Generation

Quickly generate boilerplate code for:
- Controllers with route handlers
- Services with business logic
- Middleware for request processing
- Config classes for server configuration
- WebSocket namespaces for real-time features

### âš¡ Fast Development

Development mode with automatic building and component registration. No manual imports neededâ€”the CLI discovers and registers all your components automatically.

### ðŸ“¦ Production Builds

Bundle your application with Bun's fast bundler, with full control over minification, source maps, and output options.

```bash
bun install -g @asenajs/asena-cli
